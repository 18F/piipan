# Naming convention for Azure resources

Our naming convention for Azure resources is based on the [Azure guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming) with a few tweaks:

&lt;prefix>-&lt;resource_type>-&lt;app_name>-&lt;environment>

For example:
```
tts-func-metricsapi-dev
```
This resource name would be interpreted as referring to an Azure Function App, which implements our metrics API, for the development environment, hosted within a Technology Transformation Service (TTS) Azure subscription.

A few Azure resource types (e.g., storage accounts)Â have [very restrictive naming rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules) that prevent the use of hyphens and/or significantly limit name length. In these cases:
- drop hyphens, but otherwise apply the naming convention;
- shorten &lt;app_name> until it fits within the required character length and document it.

## Naming Components

| Name | Description | 
| ---- | ----------- |
| prefix | Makes resource name globally unique in an Azure cloud, typically a short value that denotes agency/service. It is optional for resources that are not global in scope, e.g., VNets, resource groups, subscription topics. |
| resource_type | abbreviation of resource type, based on the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming#example-names-general); e.g., `psql`, `func`, `app` |
| app_name | concise name to denote purpose |
| environment | either `dev`, `test`, `stage`, or `prod`|


## Examples:

| resource | example |
| -------- | ------- |
| Resource Group | `rg-core-dev` |
| Key Vault | `tts-kv-metrics-dev` |
| Managed Identity | `id-eaadmin-dev` |
| Database for PostgreSQL | `tts-psql-metrics-dev` |
| Function App | `tts-func-metricscollect-dev` |
| Storage Account | `ttsstmetricsapidev` |

## Notes

Azure regions are not currently incorporated into the naming convention. This may need to be revisited as we address disaster recovery scenarios. Also, Azure Government cloud regions are generally longer in length than public cloud regions (e.g., `usgovarizona` vs `westus`) and will need to be abbreviated if region is added to our resource names.
