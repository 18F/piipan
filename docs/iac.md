# Infrastructure-as-Code

## Prerequisites
- [Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- `bash` shell, `/dev/urandom`, etc. via macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)Â 
- `psql` client for PostgreSQL

## Steps
To (re)create the Azure resources that `piipan` uses:
1. Run `install-extensions` to install Azure CLI extensions required by the `az` commands used by our IaC:
```
    ./iac/install-extensions.bash
```
2. Connect to a trusted network. Currently, only the GSA network block is trusted.
3. Sign in with the Azure CLI `login` command:
```
    az login
```
4. Run `create-resources`, which deploys Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and runs associated scripts:
```
    cd iac
    ./create-resources.bash
```

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are pre-configured by the Infrastructure-as-Code for Functions or Apps that require them. Most often they are used to [bind backing services to application code](https://12factor.net/backing-services) via connection strings.

| Name | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabaseConnectionString` | ADO.NET-formatted database connection string. If `Password` has the value `{password}`; i.e., `password` in curly quotes, then it is a partial connection string indicating the use of managed identities. An access token must be retrieved at run-time (e.g., via [AzureServiceTokenProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/service-to-service-authentication)) to build the full connection string.  | Piipan.Etl, Piipan.Match.State |
| `BlobStorageConnectionString` | Azure Storage Account connection string for accessing blobs. | Piipan.Etl |
| `StateApiHostStrings` | Serialized JSON array of valid URI strings for accessing each per-state matching API. | Piipan.Match.Orchestrator |
| `StateApiEndpointPath` | Relative path for per-state API Query endpoint. | Piipan.Match.Orchestrator |
| `StateName` | Name of the state associated with the Function App instance. | Piipan.Match.State |
| `StateAbbr` | Abbreviation of the state associated with the Function App instance. | Piipan.Match.State |
| `AuthorizedRoleName` | Name of the [app role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps) used to authorize requests to the per-state APIs | Piipan.Match.State |

## Notes
- `iac/states.csv` contains the comma-delimited records of participating states/territories. The first field is the [two-letter postal abbreviation](https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apb.htm); the second field is the name of the state/territory.
- For development, dummy state/territories are used (e.g., the state of `Echo Alpha`, with an abbreviation of `EA`).
- If you forget to connect to a trusted network and `create-resources` fails, connect to the network, then re-run the script.
- If you have recently deleted all the Piipan resource groups and are re-creating the infrastructure from scratch and get an `Exist soft deleted vault with the same name` error, try `az keyvault purge --name <vault-name>`. See output of `az keyvault list-deleted` for the name of the vault, which should correspond to `VAULT_NAME` in `create-resources.bash`.
- Some Azure CLI provisioning commands will return before all of their behind-the-scenes operations complete in the Azure environment. Very occasionally, subsequent provisioning commands in `create-resources` will fail as it won't be able to locate services it expects to be present; e.g., `Can't find app with name` when publishing a Function to a Function App. As a workaround, re-run the script.
- .NET 5 with Azure Functions v3 is [not (yet) supported by Microsoft](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/6674).
- `iac/.azure` contains local Azure CLI configuration that is used by `create-resources`
