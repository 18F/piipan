## Uploading Participant Data

> ⚠️ The service API for the bulk upload of PII data is not stable enough for client development. This documentation describes a _temporary_ approach that should allow states to quickly provide test data to our system with out expending development effort unnecessarily.

Once you have [validated the format](./bulk-import.md) of your participant data CSV, our recommended approach for uploading the file is through AzCopy.
#### AzCopy

AzCopy is a Microsoft-supported command line utility that you can use to upload files to Azure blob storage resources.

[Download AzCopy for your environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#run-azcopy)

For more details on using AzCopy, visit the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs-upload).

## Access

Contact a project representative to gain the necessary credentials for uploading through AzCopy.
