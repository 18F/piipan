# Piipan Metrics

*Piipan subsystem for monitoring other subsystems*

## Sources

The `metrics/src` directory contains:

* [Metrics Functions Function App](./src/PiipanMetricsFunctions) - monitors the other subsystems and stores the metrics data
* [Metrics API Function App](./src/PiipanMetricsApi) - serves metrics data to external systems
* [Metrics Shared Models](./src/Piipan.Metrics.Models) - maps data from metrics db into application objects
